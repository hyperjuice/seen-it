While arrays maintain a linear ordering through its indices, linked lists store their ordering with a pointer field <code>next</code> in each object.</p>\n\n<p>The simple singly-linked list consists of <strong>nodes</strong> with two fields:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A <code>key</code>\n</li>\n<li>A pointer <code>next</code> to the next node, or to <code>NIL</code> if it's the tail node</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Doubly linked lists add one more field: a pointer to the <em>previous</em> node, often named <code>prev</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZhCKI.png\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:400;\"></p>\n\n<p>The linked-list itself often keeps track of the <code>head</code> node and provides various operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>search(key)</code> - O(n) - which returns the found node with that <code>key</code> or <code>NIL</code> if not found</li>\n<li>\n<code>insert(x)</code> - O(1) - which splices node <code>x</code> onto the front of the list</li>\n<li>\n<code>delete(x)</code> - O(1) - which splices node <code>x</code> out of the list. Assuming the list is doubly-linked, this is usually done by re-setting the pointers of <code>x</code>'s <code>prev</code> and <code>next</code> elements to point to each other</li>\n<li>\n<code>delete(key)</code> - O(n) - which runs the O(n) search(key) then the O(1) delete(x)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few variations on the linked list you should be aware of:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Single or double - if a list is singly-linked, there is only a <code>next</code> pointer. If it is doubly-linked, there are <strong>both</strong> <code>prev</code> and <code>next</code> pointers.</li>\n<li>Sorted or unsorted - a sorted linked list maintains an ordering of node <code>key</code>s</li>\n<li>Circular - a list in which the <code>next</code> pointer of the list's <code>tail</code> element points to the <code>head</code> element</li>\n<li>Separate classes for lists and nodes (as described above) or just nodes - sometimes defining a linked list <code>Node</code> class is all you'll need for an interview question, so it's unnecessary to go through the trouble of defining a <code>List</code> class</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you are prompted to implement or perform operations on linked list in an interview, be sure you clarify what variation of the data structure you are dealing with.</p>\n\n<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to iterate through the linked list of size <code>n</code> to find an element during an operation, your operation will be at least O(n)</li>\n<li>Things that can speed up your operations: making your list doubly-linked, maintaining a <code>tail</code> pointer, </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Steps to a more comprehensive understanding</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htzJdKoEmO0\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/keVEL.png\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:450;\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you have never heard of Linked Lists, you should set aside the 52 minutes to watch this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htzJdKoEmO0\">UC Berkeley lecture on linked lists</a> or read these <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2110/2011fa/Lectures/L06-Lists/L06-Lists.pdf\">lecture notes</a> from a Cornell course</li>\n<li>Do some reading online about Sentinel nodes (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_node\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5384358/how-does-a-sentinel-node-offer-benefits-over-null\">Stack Overflow</a>) and figure out why they might be useful in certain circumstances</li>\n<li>Read about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Tradeoffs\">tradeoffs between linked lists and other data structures</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Problem of the week - linked list lightning round</h1>\n\n<p>We're having so much fun with linked lists, why stop now!</p>\n\n<p>For this week, complete these tasks:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Explain what a linked list is and what to consider when implementing one.</li>\n<li>Implement a simple singly-linked list data structure in your favorite language.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Then, implement two of the three following linked list interview questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Write a function to remove a list's 3rd from last element. <strong>Challenge</strong>: can you do it in a single list traversal?</li>\n<li>Write a function to remove all duplicates from a linked list. <strong>Challenge</strong>: can you do it without storing any extra data?</li>\n<li>Write a function to detect a loop in a linked list.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Spend no more than one hour attempting these problems.

We covered <strong>binary search trees</strong> a few weeks ago—clarify whether something is a binary search tree or not before jumping in on writing a solution. There may be optimizations or tricky solutions that are possible if it's a binary search tree.</p>\n\n<h3>Time and space</h3>\n\n<p>These traversal methods visit each node only once—O(n) time complexity.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of space, the recursive (and most iterative) solutions require space on the call stack, to the tune of O(tree height). In a balanced tree, that space complexity will be O(log n). <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/\">There are algorithms</a> to traverse a tree without a stack or recursion, but I suspect you won't be asked that in an interview.</p>\n\n<h2>Steps to a more comprehensive understanding</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwGnROlB58\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bPryz.png\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:450;\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you haven't previously learned about or implemented tree traversal methods, you should set aside the 54 minutes to watch this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwGnROlB58\">UC Berkeley lecture on trees and traversals</a> or read these <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-204-computer-algorithms-in-systems-engineering-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT1_204S10_lec06.pdf\">lecture notes</a> from an MIT civil and environmental engineering course, starting at slide #11</li>\n<li>Take a look at some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order\">iterative implementations</a> of tree traversals.

When you hit the end of a word, you mark the node as a valid word stopping point. In doing so, you would be constructing a <strong>trie</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Construct and find</h3>\n\n<p>To <strong>construct</strong> a simple trie (or prefix tree):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For each key, deconstruct your key <code>k</code> (usually your dictionary word) into a sequence of subkeys. For example, <code>\"catatonic\"</code> could become <code>\"c\", \"a\", \"t\", \"a\", \"t\", \"o\", \"n\", \"i\", \"c\"</code>.</li>\n<li>Starting from the root, for each remaining subkey, create and enter a new child node.</li>\n<li>When you are out of subkeys, mark the final, deepest node as a valid key.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To perform a <strong>search</strong> on a trie:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For each subkey (or letter), enter the child node for that subkey.

  {name: "Issue 7: Singleton", content: "\n\n<p>Or, the loneliest of the design patterns.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yZMqZ.gif\" border=\"0\"></p>\n\n<h2>Why review the Singleton pattern?</h2>\n\n<p>Design pattern questions show up in many interviews, especially for more senior engineers. If you're interviewing for internships or straight out of college, mastery of design patterns is a very positive sign, but not knowing them usually won't hurt you. For more senior engineering positions, knowledge of design patterns is a must.</p>\n\n<p>Though controversial, the <strong>singleton</strong> design pattern shows up in many interviews and codebases, and is often a good starting point for object-oriented design dicussion. In <a href=\"http://amzn.com/098478280X?tag=a202-20\">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>, under the table \"Absolute must-have knowledge\", the two design patterns listed are <strong>singleton</strong> and <strong>factory</strong> (which we'll review in a future issue).</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the singleton pattern when you see it and knowing how and when to supplant it with something more flexible can also come in handy during tough refactorings.</p>\n\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>singleton</strong> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern\">Wikipedia</a>) is a design pattern that restricts instantiation of a class to <strong>one object</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, you create a class that maintains a reference to the only instance of itself.</p>\n\n<p>The singleton's key value propositions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ensuring there is <strong>only one instance</strong> of a class</li>\n<li>Giving a <strong>global point of access</strong> for that class</li>\n<li>(optional) Using this single point of access to control when initialization happens</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>How to use it</h3>\n\n<p>Here's a UML diagram of an example singleton class:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/34lKDe3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The most important things to notice:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The constructor (<code>Singleton() : void</code>) is <strong>private</strong>. This lets the Singleton class ensure no outside code can create another instance. In some languages, <a href=\"http://blog.pixelbreaker.com/actionscript-3-0/as30-better-singletons\">such as AS3</a>, constructors can't be declared private, so other methods are used to enforce the singleton invariant.</li>\n<li>The singleton <code>instance</code> object can either be (1) <strong>lazy initialized</strong> in the <code>getInstance()</code> function or (2) <strong>eager initialized</strong> in the <code>instance</code> field declaration</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>When to use it</h3>\n\n<p>As one StackOverflow poster <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228164/on-design-patterns-when-to-use-the-singleton\">put it</a>, there are \"very few acceptable reasons to use a Singleton\". Singletons often get over-used, as we'll see in the Drawbacks section. </p>\n\n<p>Common singletons you might come across:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shared resources that get accessed often from all over the codebase, e.g., a single handle for a <strong>database connection</strong>, a simple <strong>logger</strong>, a shared print spooler</li>\n<li>Read-only singletons, e.g., configuration information that should only be written to at startup time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Drawbacks and alternatives</h3>\n\n<p><em>(Or, why <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/singleton-considered-stupid\">Steve Yegge lies awake at night pondering how much electricity the Singleton pattern has wasted during its existence</a>.)</em></p>\n\n<h4>Singletons are difficult to unit test</h4>\n\n<p>See this post from Google's testing team about <a href=\"http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/05/tott-using-dependancy-injection-to.html\">why singletons are difficult to test</a>. They also show how to use a replacement for the static singleton accessor, <strong>dependency injection</strong>, that is easier to test. In short, you pass a reference to the single instance of the former singleton class through to the constructor for any class that wants to use the former singleton.</p>\n\n<h4>Singletons are inflexible</h4>\n\n<p>Before creating a singleton class, be sure it will <em>always</em> be a singleton. If a few months down the line you decide you want more than one instance of the class, you may have a heck of a cleanup job to do.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/singleton-considered-stupid\">Steve Yegge puts it</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\"<em>Someday you will be amazed that, by gosh, you really DO need another implementation of that dang PrintSpooler class, and it should have been an interface, a factory, and a set of implementation classes. D'oh!</em>\"</p>\n\n<h4>Singletons are \"basically just a memory leak\"</h4>\n\n<p>It's difficult to know when to deallocate a singleton.

It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed the first time you approach questions about how you would implement a large software system—heck, there are thousands of lines of code in many chess games and text editors (or a million in the case of emacs).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, making design decisions about breaking things down before diving deep into implementation details is a muscle you can exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from completing this issue's problem, a great way to practice is to habitually think about systems and how you would model it in software.

Since then, closures can be found in Lisp, ML, Smalltalk, C#, Ruby (<a href=\"http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby\">well... it's complicated</a>), Javascript, and, more explicitly with the introduction of version 8, Java.</p>\n\n<h2>Why learn about closures?</h2>\n\n<p>Interviewers often ask questions about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_scope#Lexical_scoping\">lexical scope</a> of variables and other identifiers in example pieces of code.</p>\n\n<p>Especially—</p>\n\n<h3>Scope in Javascript, or the \"last-value problem\"</h3>\n\n<p>If you profess to have Javascript experience, interview questions similar to the one <a href=\"http://frontendcoder.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/learning-javascript-via-interview-questions-closures/\">written about here</a> will often come up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function initButtons() {\n    var body = document.body,\n        button, i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n        button = document.createElement(\"button\");\n        button.innerHTML = \"Button \" + i;\n        button.addEventListener(\"click\", function (e) {\n            alert(i);\n        }, false);\n        body.appendChild(button);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>When this function is called...</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What will be displayed?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What will happen when you click on each button?</strong></p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/9KASp/\">Try it out here (JSFiddle)</a></h2>\n\n<h3>What's going on there?</h3>\n\n<p>The key closure \"gotcha\" you come across Javascript and ActionScript 3 is this—the <code>function(){}</code> defined in <code>addEventListener</code> will be accessing the variables in the outer <code>function initButtons()</code> scope, not the <code>for</code> loop <em>block-level</em> scope—unlike some other languages, <strong>Javascript does not have block-level (for, if, while, etc.) scope</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The closure captures its surrounding scope, as in, if you modified the variable inside the closure, and another closure executed later referenced that variable, the change within the first closure should show up inside the second one. As one of my brothers puts it, \"closures are one of the many reasons that it's best to avoid mutability when doing clever things\".</p>\n\n<p>Even if a variable is not of a <code>pointer</code> type, your enclosed function will be looking at and modifying the variable in the enclosing scope directly. Closures actually <strong>capture the scope</strong>, not just a snapshot of the variables in that scope.</p>\n\n<p>This scope question is a favorite of interviewers because it is seen as a shortcut to differentiate between intermediate and advanced Javascript developers. The idea is, however right or wrong, if you've done a <em>lot</em> of programming in Javascript, you'll have been bitten by the function / block scoping distinction while using closures in Javascript in the past.</p>\n\n<h5>Getting around it</h5>\n\n<p>To work around this issue, you can exploit the fact that closures can capture <strong>function-level</strong> scope while closures within (for, if, while, etc.) blocks can not (because there is no block-level scope).</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://frontendcoder.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/learning-javascript-via-interview-questions-closures/\">Nathaniel Lee's post</a>, he describes a common solution to this problem:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    button.addEventListener(\"click\", function (j) {\n        return function (e) {\n            alert(j);\n        };\n    }(i), false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nathaniel defines and calls a function that simply returns our original function—but passes in <code>i</code> to the outer function as a parameter. Since this outer function is immediately called (the <code>}(i)</code> portion), addEventListener() receives a function that references <code>j</code>, the current value of <code>i</code>—0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.</p>\n\n<h2>How are closures implemented?</h2>\n\n<p>Closures are usually implemented with a data structure that contains (1) a pointer to the function code and (2) a representation of the function's lexical environment at the time of closure creation.</p>\n\n<p>Closures require that the variables they reference stay around until the time the closure is executed (in the example above, the variable <code>i</code> would need to stick around until we click a button). Typically, languages that support closures use garbage collection as a mechanism to retain referenced chunks of memory. Languages that use a linear stack-based execution and memory model face a greater challenge in implementing closures, known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funarg_problem\">Funarg, or \"functional argument\" problem</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What are closures often used for?</h2>\n\n<p>Closures are used for a number of things, including many basic language constructs. Here is an excellent <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff696765.aspx\">writeup and list of examples</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of what you might come across during interviews, particularly important to note are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/\">Javascript <strong>module</strong> pattern</a>—in this, closures are used to store private variables and methods while public properties and methods are returned as an object (for those unfamiliar with Javascript, essentially a dictionary / associative array).</li>\n<li>Using closures to create \"counter\" functions and for constructing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\">memoizing</a> versions of functions</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Steps to a more comprehensive understanding</h2>\n\n<p></p>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zVizaCOhME\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rVB9MxX.png\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:450;\"></a></center>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Spend a bit of time and skip around this two-hour long <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zVizaCOhME\">Google Tech Talk on the implementation of Closures for Java</a>. While a bit long, it does an excellent job of covering features of closures and considerations in implementation (and has some awesome picture-in-picture video effects). Otherwise, <a href=\"http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/%7Eclarkson/courses/csci4223/2013sp/lec/lec12.pdf\">these lecture notes from a GW course on programming languages</a> provide a nice explanation of closures in Standard ML. I couldn't find a suitable lecture video on closures this week—if anyone finds one, let me know <a href=\"http://twitter.com/interviewcoding\">@interviewcoding</a> and I'll retweet it.</li>\n<li>Take a look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29\">Wikipedia article on Closures</a> and, if you're especially interested, this comp.lang.javascript <a href=\"http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/\">description of closure implementation in ECMAScript (Javascript)</a>. The Wikipedia article's section on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29#Closure_leaving\">closure-leaving</a> highlights some key differences between languages. The section on closure-like constructs highlights <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29#Closure-like_constructs\">some disgusting things</a> you can do to emulate full closures.</li>\n<li>If you have some <strong>Javascript</strong> experience, read through Nathaniel's closure <a href=\"http://frontendcoder.wordpress.com/2013/01/29/learning-javascript-via-interview-questions-closures/\">interview question</a> again to confirm you understand the block scoping issue and workaround. If you're more of a <strong>Ruby-ist</strong>, <a href=\"http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby\">this sample code</a> will illustrate some of the finer points of scope in Ruby.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Problem of the week - Reversed Are Words These</h1>\n\n<p>This problem is a simpler one, so you can give it a shot <em>right now</em>. Write a function which, given a sentence like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Coding for Interviews contains too many gifs.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Returns the sentence with the order of the words reversed, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    gifs. many too contains Interviews for Coding\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The catch is: your function should use <code>O(1)</code> space. <em>What is your algorithm's time complexity?</em></p>\n\n<p>If you get stuck, you can find a solution in <a href=\"http://amzn.com/1479274836?tag=a202-20\">Elements of Programming Interviews</a> page 197.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is a simpler problem, <strong>submit by next Tuesday</strong>. I will send out a short update issue with your solutions and <strong>another problem</strong> (and save the next topic review for the following week).</p>\n\n", user_id: nil, difficulty: "", link: "http://codingforinterviews.com/archive/paradigmsareconstructed@gmail.com-1bc404/issue/10", tag_id: nil},

  {name: "Issue 20: Breadth-First Search", content: "\n\n<p>Breadth-first search is a tree traversal algorithm that visits the nodes of a tree <strong>level by level</strong>, increasing the depth after each row's traversal.</p>\n\n<h2>What is BFS used for?</h2>\n\n<p>You'll come across BFS in a few common situations—</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>finding the <strong>shortest path</strong> between two nodes in a graph—like LinkedIn finding the friends-of-friends.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>filesystem traversal</strong>—while UNIX find is a pre-order depth-first search, some prefer breadth-first for faster searches in certain situations (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gnu.emacs.sources/cpetntP4Ziw\">like this Emacs-er from 1999</a>)</li>\n<li>generally <strong>printing hierarchies</strong> in rank-order... e.g., if you wanted to print a tree of military officers by their level in the rank hierarchy</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>What does it look like?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug2hLQv6WeY\">Pop quiz, hot-shot</a>! You have a tree. And your task is to verbally breadth-first traverse it. What do you do?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CdYi6qm.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Well, a breadth-first printing of the tree would be <code>1 2 3 4 5</code>. Each row, you visit the nodes from left to right.</p>\n\n<h2>How do you perform a BFS?</h2>\n\n<p>When you’re performing a breadth-first traversal, you need some sort of way to keep track of where you’ve been (otherwise, looking at a given node, you wouldn’t know which node to visit next).</p>\n\n<p>One way is to <strong>use a queue</strong> to maintain a list of nodes to visit next, remove the nodes and their add children to the end of the queue as you visit them.</p>\n\n<p>The general steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Add the root node</strong> to the queue</li>\n<li>While there are still any nodes in the queue:\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Remove and visit</strong> the front node in the queue</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Add</strong> each of the current node's <strong>children</strong> to the queue</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's an animated version (from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">Wikipedia on BFS</a>)—<strong><font color=\"gray\">gray nodes</font></strong> are the ones remaining in the queue. <strong>Black nodes</strong> are the ones which have been visited.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dkdJzSx.gif\"></p>\n\n<h3>BFS -&gt; DFS with just one swap</h3>\n\n<p>If you <strong>swap out the queue</strong> in that algorithm <strong>for a stack</strong>, you'd get a depth-first search. Can you wrap your head around why that is?</p>\n\n<h3>In graphs to avoid cycles</h3>\n\n<p>Unlike trees, graphs can have <strong>cycles</strong>—paths from a given node around to itself. When you're performing a breadth-first search of a graph, you will want to avoid getting caught up in these cycles, as they can cause the algorithm to never terminate (though, unlike depth-first searches, it will continue to traverse the entire graph).</p>\n\n<p>To counter this, a common approach is to <strong>mark visited graph nodes</strong> as you go along and ignore them when encountered later. This marking can be done either as an attribute on the node or by maintaining a set of visited nodes.</p>\n\n<h1>This week's challenge: The Sta<i>queue</i>\n</h1>\n\n<p>This week's challenge—not directly related to BFS—is to <strong>implement a queue using two stacks</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Queues</em> are a <strong>first-in-first-out</strong> data structure that we just saw used as a \"next to visit\" data store in breadth-first search.</p>\n\n<p><em>Stacks</em> are a <strong>last-in-first-out</strong> data structure used in depth-first search, and can often be used to implement recursive algorithms iteratively (because the call stack is, itself, a stack).</p>\n\n<p>For this problem, you are to create a queue using two stacks. So your <code>Queue</code> will support the operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>enqueue(item)</code>, which inserts an item into the queue</li>\n<li>\n<code>dequeue()</code>, which removes and returns the oldest item in the queue</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your two <code>Stack</code>s (which your programming language may have available already, otherwise you can create your own pretty easily) have the following operations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>push(item)</code>, which inserts an item at the top of the stack</li>\n<li>\n<code>pop()</code>, which removes and returns the top item of the stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's say we just tried using one stack as a queue, pushing instead of enqueueing:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WwEoOmI.gif\" width=\"200/\"></p>\n\n<p>Not so easy! (BTW—we'll see the wonderful source of these animations with next week's solutions).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you figure out a way to make a queue using two stacks?</strong> Give it a shot, if you get stuck, try drawing some pictures or working through sample inputs with your work-in-progress. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Time complexity</strong>: what is the time complexity of your solution? An <code>O(m)</code> solution is possible, where <code>m</code> is the number of enqueue and dequeue operations performed. Can you figure one out? Hint—does it matter if an operation is expensive the first time you do it, and then really cheap afterwards?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus points</strong> for solutions with visualizations!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extra bonus followup</strong>: Use your fancy new <code>Queue</code> to hold integers, but now add an <code>O(1)</code> time <code>getMinimum</code> operation, which returns the smallest integer in the queue. What are the extra space requirements for this operation?</p>\n\n<p><em>Thanks to group members Asim Ihsan, Andrew Yates and Greg Jordan for their feedback on this issue!</em></p>\n\n", user_id: nil, difficulty: "", link: "http://codingforinterviews.com/archive/paradigmsareconstructed@gmail.com-1bc404/issue/20", tag_id: nil}
